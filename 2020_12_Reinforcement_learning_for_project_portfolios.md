Focus: **The monthly portfolio review**

Build on:
- **a well-defined project portfolio**
- **with a clear project lifecycle**
- **the portfolio is regularly updated**

Move to:
- **Making decisions about projects each month**
- **Anticipating and handling uncertainty**

# 1 Starter Question

Which starter question do you prefer ?

1. **What decisions can we make ?**
2. *What are we trying to achieve?*

# 1.5 Basic Model 0

Decision > New information > ....

> x0
> **Project decision**

>>W1, x1
>> **Project progress, New project decision**

>>> W2, x2...
					

# 2 Basic Model I 

State > Decision > New Information & new State ....

>> S0,x0
>> **Project status, Project decision**

>> W1,S1,x1
>> **Project progress, New Project status, New project decision**

>>> W2,S2,x2...

Can also think of this as action > value > action> value...

# 2.1 Alternate visualisation

|  start|  | month 1 | | month 2|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|  |  |  W1| | W2|
| S0|  | S1 | |S2|
| x0 |  | x1 | |x2|

# 3 Basic Model II 

Minimum of two components
1. New information (W)
2. Decisions       (x)

> *maximum expectation of some function of (x,W)*

With up to three more: 
4. Objective
5. State
5. Transition function
*Objective function* allows the long-term direction to be set
Tracking 
*state* avoids myopic focus on the next reward
*Transition function* takes advantage of our knowledge of dynamics or mechanics of the situation

# 4 Basic Model III

- 'Information & Decision Analytics'
- a.k.a Reinforcement Learning
- Two USPs:
	- handles uncertainty
	- handles decisions over time
- So
	- *goes beyond boiling down uncertainty into 3/4 scenarios*
	- *whilst not needing a decision tree that explodes*
# 3 Decision variables
Decisions (x) or actions (a) or continuous efforts u

|  Lifecycle decisions|  Assurance actions| Control actions |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Project advances |  Investigate|  |
|  Project suspended|  Review|  |
|  Project cancelled| Assure |  |

More than one agent making key decisions ? *No*

# 4 Objective function
# 5 Uncertainty
# 6 State
# 7 State Transitions
# 8 Policies that meet the Objective function
# 9 The intuition: the closest analogy
# 10 Management insight for this use case
Parallels OODA thus 
# 11 Pre-requisites for this use-case
*State machine* etc
# 12 Management improvements
1. data: are we gathering W regularly and effectively?
2. promptitude: are we making decisions as per agreed cadence?
3. exploration/ exploitation ? i.e epsilon-greedy ?
5. other myopic strategy suitable ?
6. change tick-rate ? (alpha) step size parameter
7. do we need optimistic initial values ?
# 13 What else does this tell us ?

Is this situation:
stationary ? *yes*
ergodic ? *no*
a contextual bandit ?

Benefits
- manages uncertainty as first-class citizen
- selects which decision reduces uncertainty
- Algorithm for selecting best project design
- long term benefits vs costs balanced on-the-fly
Why it works
- reinforcement learning
 - integrated framework for sequential decisions
 - learns the next best decision from the last decision
